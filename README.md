# The backend server to the Madness
This is the backend server for quackie chattie.  
This server has been deployed to Heroku and implements Heroku Postgres for the database backend.
If you're interested, I'll include the very simple ERD I created to design the database.  


## Questions you may have
If you're wondering "Why is your codebase such a mess?"  
It's because I live life on the edge and knocked this out in one night with a fistfull of hope and an IV drip bag full of the most potent caffeine.  
The worst part? This wasn't for school or a client. I literally had FUN doing this.  
  
Fret not, I will refactor my codebase soon.
