# The backend server to the Madness
This is the backend server for quackie chattie.  
This server has been deployed to Heroku and implements Heroku Postgres for the database backend.
If you're interested, I'll include the very simple ERD I created to design the database.

# Tools Used:
- Heroku
- Heroku Postgres (database)
