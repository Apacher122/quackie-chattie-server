# QuackieChattie server
This is the backend server for quackie chattie.  
This server has been deployed to Heroku and implements Heroku Postgres for the database backend.
If you're interested, I'll include the very simple ERD I created to design the database.  
I built this entire project on a modification of the PERN stack (no React.js was used *yet*)  
  
PLEASE NOTE: For obvious reasons, you can run this code locally but cannot connect to the DB. However if you feel like playing around with it, you can modify the server code to connect to a local PostgresSQL DB.

## Questions you may have
If you're wondering "Why is your codebase such a mess?"  
It's because I live life on the edge and knocked this out in one night with a fistfull of hope and an IV drip bag full of the most potent caffeine.  
The worst part? This wasn't for school or a client. I did this just because I felt like doing it.
  
Fret not, I am currently refactoring and beautifying my code.
